    <h2>Challenges of multiplatform apps</h2>
    <p>
      The app we developed is meant to run on a few different devices, altough, for this iteration we only "implemented" the design for mobile devices and wearables such as smartwatches.
      On the mobile devices side of things, we mostly based our design on simple floating buttons so that we keep our app a simple experience for all types of users, no matter their age or 
      what else, also we plan on using tons of videos with short descriptions and colorful backgrounds into which to buttons melt seemlessly. As per the watch side of things, we took things a
      notch down, getting rid of most of the features and keeping only essentials that could be of help to users, we still have the simple floating buttons and colorful backgrounds, and we have 
      only a handful of features, we have a alarm for stress, reminders for various tasks and a easy menu for assistance during quick excersises such as walking and stretching.
    </p>
    <h2>Transfering from Stage D to Stage F</h2>
    <p>
      Transfering from one component to the other was a big step for our team, besides coming up with a better design that we hoped you liked, we decided to add a few more features
      on the mobile side of the app so that we could make our app more useful.
      On the smartwatch side of things, we kept a more rudimentary style. The app matches the previously done sketches, we wanted to have more of a simple style because there
      seemed to be no reason why a watch app should be "complex", besides, the watch is more for monitoring different levels like anxiety, stress and heartbeat than to help you 
      become a calmer person in general. On that note, the watch is best suited for quick tasks like keeping up with your exercises and monitoring your emotional state, the more
      important tasks are for the phone app.
      The phone app, on the other hand, is a step up from last component's sketches, besides implementing things like activities and goal trackers, we added a few more things 
      such as: a music tab, a sleep calendar, a "today" page that recommends different activities daily. The phone app, similar to what could've been a web app, is meant to 
      cater to more needs, it provides meditation guides curated by different "meditation masters", exercise guides also and besides all of those, we have extended dashboards
      that represent different emotional status for the costumer which he may later present to a psychiatrist.
    </p>
    <h2>Design Choices and accesability features</h2>
      <p>
      The design of our apps is meant to be a friendly and comforting one. We picked a cute, peaceful mauve color on a mostly white background. We feel like this choice should
      make the users feel safer and more welcome while using the app. Aside from that we mostly use other warm, calming colors and even a few cute illustrations of a sun.
      </p>
      <p>
      On the accesability side of things, we tried to keep things as simple as possible making use of large buttons and thumbnails for our videos.
      </p>
    <h2>Interaction design patters</h2>
    <p>
      Among the interaction designs we used in our apps, we have tons of taps, for interacting with a lot of things like: playing videos, opening menus etc., we have tap, hold
      and drags for sliders on smartwatches and controlling videos on mobiles, swipes on watches for going back to a previous menu and long presses on phones for previewing videos.
