    <h2>Challenges of multiplatform apps</h2>
    <p>
      The app we developed is meant to run on a few different devices, altough, for this iteration we only "implemented" the design for mobile devices and wearables such as smartwatches.
      On the mobile devices side of things, we mostly based our design on simple floating buttons so that we keep our app a simple experience for all types of users, no matter their age or 
      what else, also we plan on using tons of videos with short descriptions and colorful backgrounds into which to buttons melt seemlessly. As per the watch side of things, we took things a
      notch down, getting rid of most of the features and keeping only essentials that could be of help to users, we still have the simple floating buttons and colorful backgrounds, and we have 
      only a handful of features, we have a alarm for stress, reminders for various tasks and a easy menu for assistance during quick excersises such as walking and stretching.
